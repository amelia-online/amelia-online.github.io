                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    My name is Amelia. I'm a recent graduate from the University of Utah; I majored in
                    Computer Science with a special interest in programming language design and
                    compilers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm looking to get into the industry as an entry-level software engineer. I'm passionate about computer science, and I want
                    to make software that will change the world for the better--even if just a little bit.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In my free time I like to work on personal projects, most of which are on my <a href="https://github.com/amelia-online">GitHub</a> page.
                    Right now I'm currently working on developing my own C library that contains essential data structures such as 
                    dynamic arrays, hashmaps, improved strings, and more. It will also include macros to generate code to make
                    said data structures mostly type generic. My goal is to use this library in future C projects to make development
                    faster. I've also been continually working on an interpreter--and hopefully soon to be compiler--for a language called 
                    <a href="https://gitlab.com/tsoding/porth">Porth</a> by Tsoding.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Besides computer science, I love to hang out with my friends, play video games, read (usually old Star Wars novels), 
                    go to the gym, and cuddle with my pets.
                </p>
