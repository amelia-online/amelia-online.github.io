                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    My name is Amelia. I'm a recent graduate from the University of Utah; I majored in
                    Computer Science with a special interest in programming language design and
                    compilers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm looking to get into the industry as an entry-level software engineer. I'm passionate about computer science, and I want
                    to make software that will change the world for the better--even if just a little bit.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In my free time I like to work on personal projects, most of which are on my <a href="https://github.com/amelia-online">GitHub</a> page.
                    Right now I'm currently working on developing my own C library that contains essential data structures such as 
                    dynamic arrays, hashmaps, improved strings, and more. It will also include macros to generate code to make
                    said data structures mostly type generic. My goal is to use this library in future C projects to make development
                    faster. I've also been continually working on an interpreter--and hopefully soon to be compiler--for a language called 
                    <a href="https://gitlab.com/tsoding/porth">Porth</a> by Tsoding.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Besides computer science, I love to hang out with my friends, play video games, read (usually old Star Wars novels), 
                    go to the gym, and cuddle with my pets.

                    Here is list of some notable projects I made either as part of a class or on my own time.

                            FindU is a platform for facilitating interdisciplinary collaboration.
                            It was created for my Senior Capstone classes in a team of 4.
                            Using Java Spring Boot, I worked on the backend to design and 
                            implement different aspects of the website such as chats, notifications,
                            user roles, and more smaller details. 
                        </dd>
                        <dt>JPL Compiler</dt>
                        <dd>
                            As part of my Compilers class, I developed a full compiler for a language called
                            JPL (John Pavel Lang). The compiler included a full lexer, parser, typechecker, 
                            and code generation to C and x86 Assembly (NASM) with -O1 and -O3 optimizations.
                            Here is a snippet of the language:
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <pre><code>
read image "cat.jpg" to catImg                         
fn modify(img[H, W] : rgba[,]) : rgba[,] {                        
    return array [i : H, j : W] rgba { \
        img[i, j].r * 0.5, \
        img[i, j].g * 0.6, \
        img[i, j].b * 0.3, \
        1.0                \
    }
}
let final = modify(catImg)
write image catImg to "result.jpg"
                            </code></pre>

                            <br>
                            <br>

                            The code above reads an image and stores it to a variable. It creates a new image by calling the <code>modify</code> function
                            which copies the image but modifies the r, g, and b values. The resulting image is then written to "result.jpg."

                        </dd>
                        <dt>Sprite Editor</dt>
                        <dd>
                            As part of my Software Practice II class, I, in a team of four, helped develop a
                            program that allows the user to draw sprites and record animations with them. The
                            user will draw each frame of the sprite's animation, and the editor will play it back
                            to the user at a specified frame-rate. The editor also provides different editing tools
                            and colors. The application was implemented in C++ and Qt.
                        </dd>
                        <dt>Snake Game</dt>
                        <dd>
                            As part of my Software Practice I class, the final project was to create a multiplayer
                            battle-royale-like snake game in C# using .NET MAUI from scratch. In teams of 2, my partner
                            and I created a network controller, graphical client, and game server. The client initiated
                            a handshake with the server which consisted of the client sending information such as a username, 
                            and the server replying with information about the game arena.
                        </dd>
                        <dt>HTTP Proxy Server</dt>
                        <dd>
                            As part of my Computer Networks class, our first big project was to create an HTTP 1.0 proxy server
                            in Python. The server only supported GET requests, however, the server was able to process multiple
                            clients at once using threads. Additionally, the server cached the responses, and allowed the client
                            to disable the cache or clear the cache. The client could also block websites with a built-in blocklist.
                        </dd>
                        <dt>Cpporth</dt>
                        <dd>
                            This is the Porth interpreter I previously mentioned. Written in C++, I wrote a custom lexer, custom parser,
                            and typechecker, as well as some of my own custom language features. I am not the creator of Porth, and there
                            isn't a lot of documentation on it. I tried to get my interpreter to match the behavior of the actual language
                            as much as possible. Testing using googletest is what I'm working on now.

                <p>
                    I cannot publicly release the code of the projects from school due to university policies. However, please feel free to visit
                    my GitHub profile to see all of my personal projects, including those not listed here.
